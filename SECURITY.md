# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive bugs.

Preferred: open a GitHub Security Advisory for this repository (if enabled).

If that is not available, contact the maintainers privately and include:
- What you found and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- A minimal proof-of-concept (if possible)
- Affected versions / commit(s)

## Supported versions

This project is early-stage. Security fixes may land on the latest version only.
