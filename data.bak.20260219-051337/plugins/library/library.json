      "text": "(Survivor Radio 4 : GUS, THE JANITOR)\n\n\nDAY 1 — Gus Broadcast #1\nGus:\nUh. Hello?\nIs this thing on?\nYeah. Okay.\nThis is Gus. Facilities management. Or… I was.\nNow see, I don’t know where everybody went, but I gotta say, the east wing looks better without teenagers draggin’ mud through it.\nYou ever notice how folks’ll complain about the smell of bleach, but nobody complains when the place smells like feet?\nStandards, people.\nAnyway, if anyone’s still around — somebody left a cart of canned peaches in the cafeteria.\nI took two. Not greedy. Just practical.\nAlso, whoever’s been moanin’ outside the gymnasium at night?\nYou gotta hydrate. That’s not healthy.\nAlright. I’m gonna go fix the flickerin’ light in the stairwell.\nCan’t have chaos and poor lighting.\nThat’s how accidents happen.\n________________\n\n\n\n\nDAY 2 — Gus Broadcast #2\nGus:\nOkay.\nNow I don’t mean to alarm anybody.\nBut I was mopin’ the hallway by science lab three — because SOMEONE spilled somethin’ suspiciously chunky —\nand there’s folks wanderin’ around real slow today.\nVery unmotivated.\nNobody respondin’ to “Excuse me.”\nThat’s rude.\nNow, I tried tappin’ one on the shoulder with my mop handle.\nDidn’t react much.\nSo I assume they’re union.\nAnyway.\nIf you’re out there, please stop leavin’ doors open.\nSecurity is important.\nAnd if you’re feelin’ under the weather, maybe lie down somewhere comfortable instead of in the middle of the corridor.\nYou’re creatin’ a trippin’ hazard.\nThank you.\n________________\n\n\n\n\nDAY 3 — Gus Broadcast #3\nGus:\nAlright.\nI think we need to talk about the smell.\nIt’s gettin’ persistent.\nNow I’ve dealt with gym locker rooms in August. I’ve dealt with cafeteria milk incidents. I have SEEN things.\nBut this?\nThis is ambitious.\nAlso — small note — if you’re gonna bang on the supply closet door for six hours straight?\nYou better be willin’ to help reorganize the shelving when I let you out.\nBecause I just alphabetized the solvents.\nAnd I will not be doin’ that twice.\nI dunno what’s goin’ on exactly.\nBut I will say this.\nIf this is some kind of drill?\nYou’re all failing.\nOn the bright side though—\nParking’s never been easier.\nAlright. Gus out.\nI’m takin’ my break.\nAnd if anyone touches my thermos?\nThere will be consequences.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 4 — Gus Realizes\nGus:\n…Alright.\nOkay.\nSo.\nI may have misjudged the situation.\nNow, I’ve been in facilities long enough to recognize patterns.\nAnd when multiple individuals ignore direct verbal instruction, exhibit poor hygiene, and attempt to bite you—\nThat’s not union.\nThat’s somethin’ else.\nI was in the cafeteria this morning.\nOne of ‘em slipped on a patch I’d just mopped.\nDidn’t even try to catch himself.\nThat’s when it hit me.\nThey’re not slow.\nThey’re gone.\n…\nWell.\nThat’s unfortunate.\nAnyway.\nBlood stains come out easier if you hit ‘em before they set.\nCold water first. Always.\nHot water cooks it in.\nIf anybody’s still alive and listenin’—\nclean as you go.\nWorld might be endin’.\nBut grime is a choice.\nGus out.\nI got the west hallway lookin’ respectable.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 5 — The Fall of Linda\nGus:\nI don’t have much to say today.\nLinda snapped.\nRight at the handle.\n1992 composite shaft.\nThey stopped makin’ ‘em like that after the budget cuts.\nI warned ‘em.\nNobody listens.\nI was clearin’ the front office.\nHad three of those biters comin’ down the stairs.\nLinda held.\nLong as she could.\nGood reach. Good balance.\nSaved my knees more times than I can count.\nThen—\ncrack.\nSplit clean.\n…\nI had to finish the job with a broom.\nA broom.\nYou ever try defendin’ yourself with somethin’ meant for dust?\nHumiliatin’.\nAnyway.\nI buried her out back.\nNear the flagpole.\nSeemed appropriate.\nIf anyone finds a decent hardwood handle out there—\nlet me know.\nStandards still matter.\nEven now.\nGus out.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 6 — The Burnisher Incident\nGus:\nAlright.\nSo I’d like to address the situation in the main lobby.\nFirst of all—\nwho unplugged the floor burnisher and left it crooked?\nYou can’t just abandon a machine like that.\nThat’s how cords get tangled.\nAnyway.\nI was runnin’ it this morning. Figured if we’re gonna have the end of civilization, we can at least have a respectable shine on the tile.\nMidway through the second pass, I notice a crowd gatherin’.\nThought maybe folks were finally admirin’ the gloss.\nNope.\nJust more of those shamblers.\nNow here’s the thing about a commercial burnisher—\nHigh torque.\nHeavy chassis.\nGood forward momentum.\nYou lean into it, it does the rest.\nAnd let me tell you—\nit did the rest.\n…\nLobby’s clear.\nVery clear.\nHowever—\nthere are… fragments.\nEverywhere.\nAnd someone bled directly onto the grout lines I sealed last week.\nUnacceptable.\nIf you’re operatin’ heavy machinery during a crisis, please be mindful of splash radius.\nAlso, small note—\nif you see a man pushin’ 90 pounds of industrial equipment toward you at speed?\nStep aside.\nThat’s common courtesy.\nAnyway.\nI’ll be in the lobby for the next few hours.\nTryin’ to get this back to presentable.\nGloss is gone, obviously.\nBut we’ll recover.\nWe always do.\nGus out.\nAnd if anyone touches the extension cord—\nI will know.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 7 — Survivor Frequency Crossover\n[static crackle — overlapping frequencies]\nGus:\n Uh—\nThere’s… another signal on this channel.\nYou’re crossin’ lines, ma’am.\nThis is a public frequency.\nYou can’t just—\n…well. I suppose you can.\nErin (calm, amused):\n I’ve heard about you.\nLobby burnisher incident.\nGrout preservation specialist.\nYou sound busy.\nGus:\n Standards don’t collapse just because society does.\nAnd for the record, that burnisher’s torque did most of the work.\nI was merely guiding.\nErin:\n That’s usually how it works.\nYou guide.\nThe machine follows.\nGus (grunts approvingly):\n Finally, someone who understands equipment.\nYou mop?\nErin:\n When I have to.\nCold water first for blood.\nGus:\n …Correct.\nHot water sets it.\nMost people don’t know that.\nErin:\n Most people don’t pay attention.\nYou do.\nGus (pause):\n Used to have a mop.\nNamed her Linda.\nComposite handle. ‘92 model.\nGood balance.\nSnapped last week.\nI buried her.\nFlagpole.\nSeemed right.\n[short silence]\nErin (gentler):\n You didn’t lose her.\nYou learned her.\nEvery mop you hold now—\nthat balance, that grip, that instinct?\nThat’s Linda.\nShe lives in your hands.\nAnd in the shine you leave behind.\n[longer pause — Gus exhales]\nGus:\n …That’s a ridiculous thing to say.\nErin:\n I know.\nGus:\n …\nBut it’s… structurally sound.\nErin (smiles in voice):\n Standards matter.\nEven now.\nEspecially now.\nGus:\n You keep your corners clean, ma’am.\nErin:\n You keep the floors shining, Gus.\nMusic persists.\nAnd so does good work.\nGus (quietly):\n …Copy that.\nGus out.\nErin:\n Survivor Frequency signing off.\nTake care of your tools.\nAnd each other.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 8 — Linda Returns\nGus:\nAlright.\nI’ve got an announcement.\nFound a replacement handle in the maintenance shed behind the gym.\nSolid hardwood. Good grain. No warping.\nTook some adjusting.\nBut she’s responsive.\nI’ve named her Linda.\nTradition matters.\nNow before anyone gets sentimental—\nthis is not the same Linda.\nThis one’s… sturdier.\nLess flex in the wrist.\nGood reach under cafeteria tables.\nVery important.\n…\nSchool’s secure.\nEast wing barricaded.\nGym doors chained.\nScience lab cleared.\nAnd for the first time in a week—\nit smells like lemon solvent again.\nAs it should.\nNow here’s the situation.\nI’ve been hearin’ chatter on the Survivor Frequency.\nFolks lookin’ for shelter.\nTalkin’ about regrouping here.\nAt the school.\nWhich is fine.\nCommunity’s important.\nBut let me be very clear about something.\nIf you come into this building—\nyou wipe your boots.\nYou don’t leave wrappers in the stairwell.\nYou do not—\nunder any circumstances—\ntrack mud across a freshly sealed hallway.\nI did not wrestle a lobby full of biters with industrial equipment\njust to watch someone drop sunflower seed shells on my tile.\nWe will survive.\nBut we will survive clean.\nLinda and I are prepared.\nAre you?\nGus out.\nAnd bring your own trash bags.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 9 — New Tenants\nGus:\nAlright.\nWe’ve got occupants.\nThree, countin’ me.\nJordan. Senior. Used to roam these halls before all this went sideways.\nGood kid.\nPolite.\nCarries his weight.\nBit too into this… “grunge” business, though.\nAll that flannel and sighin’.\nI told him, “Son, if you’re gonna be melancholic, at least make it melodic.”\nWe’ll get him listenin’ to Tom Petty yet.\nThat’s structured sadness.\nBuilds character.\nNow.\nHis uncle Derrick.\nDerrick’s… enthusiastic.\nWalked in yesterday with what I can only describe as a “liberal application of blood.”\nDrippin’.\nOnto tile I personally burnished.\nI pointed it out.\nRespectfully.\nSaid, “Sir, you appear to be leakin’.”\nHe told me to shove it.\nWhich I found unnecessary.\nBut I don’t take offense.\nPeople cope different.\nStill handed him a rag.\nHe used it.\nPoorly.\nWe’re workin’ on it.\nSchool’s still secure.\nCafeteria’s operational.\nGym’s off-limits unless supervised.\nJordan’s sweepin’ without complaint.\nDerrick leaves cans in places cans do not belong.\nWe’ll adapt.\nThat’s what we do.\nOne hallway at a time.\nGus out.\nAnd if you’re gonna bleed—\nat least aim for linoleum.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 10 — “Fighting Mop”\nGus:\nJordan’s got that racket on again.\n“Nirvana.”\nSays it’s the future of music.\nI told him the future sounds like feedback and unfinished drywall.\nHe says that’s the point.\nI don’t see how that’s a point.\n“Smells Like Teen Spirit,” he says.\nWell, I’ve worked in locker rooms.\nTeen spirit smells very specific and it ain’t this.\n…\nStill.\nSecond chorus hit.\nIt’s got… momentum.\nCan’t deny momentum.\nStructured chaos.\nReminds me of a floor burnisher on uneven tile.\nTakes a minute to appreciate.\nAnyway.\nImportant announcement.\nI’ve modified Linda.\nReinforced the collar.\nWeighted the head slightly.\nWrapped the grip.\nShe’s no longer strictly custodial.\nShe is now—\na fighting mop.\nMulti-purpose design.\nJordan thinks that’s “metal.”\nI told him metal is a material, not a personality.\n…\nHold on.\nDerrick?\nYou’re walkin’ funny.\nYou good?\n…\nDerrick.\nStop.\nYou’re drippin’ again.\nWe talked about—\n…\nJordan.\nRadio down.\nNow.\n[muffled scuffle sounds — impact, breath, scraping tile]\nGus (strained but steady):\n Push him toward the lockers.\nNot the hallway.\nI just waxed that—\nNow!\n[thud — heavy metallic locker slam]\nGood.\nJordan— sweep the leg.\nI’ll handle upper structure.\n[solid impact — wet crack]\n…\n…\nWell.\nThat’s… unfortunate.\nJordan, you alright?\n…\nYeah.\nMe too.\nLinda held.\nGood torque.\nMinimal splatter radius.\nWe’ll need solvent.\nStrong one.\n…\nJordan.\nTurn that song back on.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 11 — “Left the Tape”\nGus:\nSchool’s quiet this mornin’.\nQuieter than usual.\nJordan left.\nMiddle of the night.\nDidn’t wake me.\nLeft a note on the faculty desk.\nSaid he didn’t want to slow me down.\nWhich is ridiculous.\nI move at a very reasonable pace.\n…\nHe had the decency to say goodbye.\nLeft his Nirvana tape on the counter.\nLabeled it in marker.\nUnderlined twice.\nI appreciate proper labeling.\nSaves confusion.\nHe took one of the flashlights.\nThe good one.\nSmart choice.\nMarked the map before he left.\nAlso smart.\nI don’t blame him.\nSchool’s secure.\nBut it ain’t the world.\nAnd he’s not a boy anymore.\nHe cleared lockers.\nHeld the line.\nDidn’t freeze.\nThat makes him a man.\nMakes me proud.\n…\nI put the tape in earlier.\nPlayed it through.\nStill sounds like unfinished drywall.\nBut I let it run.\nMomentum’s momentum.\nLinda and I’ll hold the fort.\nIf you’re out there, Jordan—\nkeep your corners clean.\nGus out.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 12 — “Reinforcements”\nGus:\nGot company again.\nFella named Johnson.\nHeard me on the frequency.\nSaid if a man cares that much about grout lines, the building’s probably worth stayin’ in.\nFair assessment.\nJohnson brought tools.\nActual welding rig.\nProper mask.\nDidn’t even burn the paint.\nWe reinforced the east-facing windows.\nMetal plates, clean seams.\nGood work.\nVery tidy.\nHe’s got a family with him.\nTwo kids.\nQuiet ones.\nWhich I respect.\nThey stay outta the hallways unless necessary.\nJohnson asked where to set up.\nI told him:\nAnywhere that doesn’t block access to emergency exits.\nHe laughed.\nGood sense of humor.\nHe’s stayin’ the week.\nHelpin’ secure the roof access tomorrow.\nHe even brought provisions.\nCanned goods.\nWater jugs.\nHanded me a stack and said it was “for hospitality.”\nNow I didn’t charge admission.\nBut I won’t argue with generosity.\nGood man.\nOddly generous, actually.\nBut I don’t question kindness.\nWorld’s short on it.\nSchool’s lookin’ stronger today.\nWindows plated.\nDoors reinforced.\nSmells like lemon again.\nFeels… operational.\nIf you’re thinkin’ about comin’ through—\nbring somethin’ useful.\nOr at least bring your manners.\nGus out.\nAnd if you weld near tile—\nlay down cardboard first.\nDAY 13 — “Company”\nGus:\nSchool’s louder now.\nNot in a bad way.\nJohnson’s kids run light-footed.\nI taught ’em that.\nNo heel-striking on tile.\nRespect the surface.\nJohnson’s wife—\nmakes a decent stew.\nUses too much salt.\nBut it’s warm.\nAnd warm matters.\nWe ate in the cafeteria tonight.\nProper tables.\nNo loiterin’.\nJohnson said it felt almost normal.\nI don’t think that’s the word.\nBut it felt… steady.\nI watched the kids draw on scrap paper.\nHeard laughter echo in the hallway.\nFor a minute there—\nI thought about my own.\nHad a wife once.\nTwo boys.\nThey wanted me home more.\nHard to explain pride in polish to people who don’t see the shine.\nJanitorial work ain’t glamorous.\nBut it’s honest.\nI chose it.\nAnd I don’t regret that.\nStill.\nHavin’ voices in the hallways again…\nIt’s good.\nWorld’s a mess.\nBut this corner of it?\nPresentable.\nJohnson says we’re buildin’ somethin’.\nMaybe we are.\nIf we are—\nit’ll be level.\nGus out.\nAnd if you’re settin’ the table—\nline it up straight.\n________________\n\n\nDAY 14 — “Command Structure”\nGus:\nWe’ve got numbers now.\nSix new faces since yesterday.\nOne fella brought a toolbox.\nOne brought chickens.\nOne brought opinions.\nJohnson’s been talkin’ more.\nGatherin’ folks in the cafeteria.\nPointin’ at maps.\nAssignin’ shifts.\nSecurity, watch, rationing.\nGood ideas.\nOrganized.\nI don’t mind.\nSomeone’s gotta coordinate.\nAnd I’ve got floors to burnish.\nTruth is—\nI’m better with surfaces than speeches.\nJohnson’s voice carries.\nPeople listen.\nKids stick close to him.\nHe’s got that… projector energy.\nI’ve got extension cords.\nDifferent roles.\nHe asked if we should block off the auditorium.\nSaid it’s a liability.\nI said it’s hardwood.\nNeeds maintenance.\nWe compromised.\nHe runs the perimeter.\nI run the polish.\nFair trade.\nSchool’s busier now.\nBoot prints everywhere.\nBut they wipe ’em.\nMostly.\nI’ll give him this—\nhe enforces “no mud.”\nThat earns respect.\nCommunity’s formmin’.\nHas a rhythm to it.\nNot perfect.\nBut steady.\nAnd steady’s enough.\nGus out.\nAnd if you’re holdin’ a meeting—\npush the chairs back in after.\nDAY 15 — “Unsung”\nGus:\nHeard some whisperin’ yesterday.\nCouple of the new arrivals.\nDidn’t think I could hear.\nSaid I was “just the janitor.”\nSaid it like it meant “optional.”\nNow I don’t take offense.\nPeople don’t understand infrastructure until it fails.\nJohnson’s been restructurin’ space.\nMoved some cots into the library.\nStacked supplies in the teacher’s lounge.\nEfficient enough.\nBut he didn’t account for ventilation.\nOr weight distribution on those old shelves.\nI mentioned it.\nOne of the whisperers rolled his eyes.\nSo I let him.\nThen the rain came.\nHard.\nWater found the weak seam in the east wall.\nRan straight toward the supply stack.\nYou know what keeps food dry?\nWorking drains.\nYou know who clears drains?\nNot the loudest man in the room.\nWe redirected it.\nProper slope.\nMinimal loss.\nAfterward—\nsame fella came up to me.\nDidn’t apologize.\nJust said, “Didn’t think about that.”\nI told him most people don’t.\nThat’s why floors matter.\nThat’s why walls matter.\nThat’s why someone’s gotta notice the little things.\nHe’s been callin’ me “Mr. Gus” since.\nFunny how quick a joke becomes a title.\nI don’t need praise.\nBut I won’t be dismissed either.\nWorld’s still endin’.\nBut it’s standin’ on clean tile.\nGus out.\nAnd check your drains before the storm does.\n________________\n\n\nFINAL TRANSMISSION — “Level”\nGus:\nAlright.\nWe’re packin’ up the radio.\nJohnson says we’ll need it mobile.\nSpread the signal.\nMakes sense.\nSchool’s secure enough now.\nDoesn’t need broadcastin’ as much as it needs maintainin’.\nAnd I’ve got that covered.\nKids are louder these days.\nIn a good way.\nChairs get moved.\nBoots get scuffed.\nLife’s messy.\nI’ve made peace with that.\n…\nThere’s somethin’ I should probably say.\nBeen callin’ my mop Linda.\nSome of you might’ve guessed.\nThat was my wife’s name.\nShe hated when I brought work home.\nSaid I talked more about floor wax than feelings.\nShe wasn’t wrong.\nBut she understood pride.\nUnderstood doin’ a job right.\nUnderstood that order’s a kind of love.\nSo I named the mop after her.\nFigured if I was gonna keep somethin’ upright in this world,\nit might as well carry her name.\n…\nAnd if my boys are out there—\nYou don’t gotta follow in my footsteps.\nYou don’t gotta polish anything.\nJust stand level.\nThat’s enough.\nI love you.\n…\nSchool’s lookin’ good.\nCommunity’s steady.\nJohnson’s got structure.\nErin’s got signal.\nAnd I’ve got tile.\nThat’s a solid foundation.\nThis is Gus.\nSigning off.\nKeep your corners clean.",
